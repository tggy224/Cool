<h2><strong>A Remote Control Car Activity</h2></strong>
<h1>    Yesterday I got to <a href="solder.html">solder</a> a
<a href="rca.html">remote control car </a>
! <a href="Papa.html">Papa</a> helped me by putting the wood pieces together, and I twisted the wires together. <a href="Papa.html">Papa</a> said we needed to <a href="solder.html">solder</a> it,
so we went to go get the <a href="solder.html">soldering iron</a> and the <a href="rosinwire.html">rosin wire </a>. BUT, the <a href="rosinwire.html">rosin wire</a> had disappeared! It was not there! <a href="Mama.html">Mama</a> had
to ask <a href="cindy-ai.html">Cindy A-i</a> to order it on her <a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon Prime</a>. It took 2 days for the <a href="rosinwire.html">rosin wire</a> to arrive. When it arrived, it also
came with a battery pack thing in a separate package. So I asked Papa: Can we <a href="solder.html">solder</a> the
<a href="rca.html">remote control car?</a>
But <a href="Papa.html">Papa</a> was in the middle of cooking so he said no. So later when he was not busy, I asked can we <a href="solder.html">solder</a> the
<a href="rca.html">remote control car?</a>
<a href="Papa.html">Papa</a> still said no, but he said I CAN! He got the <a href="solder.html">soldering iron</a>, the new <a href="rosinwire.html">rosin wire</a>, and a cup with a wet towel in it
to clean the <a href="solder.html">soldering iron</a>. I got the battery for the <a href="solder.html">soldering iron</a>. After some time the <a href="solder.html">soldering</a> was done! Now me
and <a href="Papa.html">Papa</a> just put in the wood pieces and attached the long wire. And then I tested it out and it worked!!! The
<a href="rca.html">remote control car </a>
actually worked!!! Then <a href="Mama.html">Mama</a> tried and said it was so cool! The <a href="rca.html">remote control car </a>
is so cool!</h1>
